# üå¶Ô∏è Weather Type Classification Web Application üå¶Ô∏è

Welcome to the Weather Type Classification Web Application repository! This project is a Flask-based ML web application designed to classify different weather types such as Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy, and Snowy using multiple machine learning models. Whether you're a data science enthusiast, a machine learning practitioner, or just curious about weather classification, this web app provides an interactive platform to explore and understand how models can predict weather patterns.

## Overview ‚ÑπÔ∏è

In today's world of interconnected technologies, the ability to accurately predict weather conditions is crucial for various industries such as agriculture, transportation, and emergency services. This web application leverages the power of machine learning to classify different weather types based on historical data. By utilizing models like decision trees, deep learning, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines (SVM), the application provides users with insights into how these models can be trained and deployed for weather classification tasks.

## Features üõ†Ô∏è

- Interactive UI for inputting weather data
- Classification of weather types: Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy, Snowy
- Multiple machine learning models for comparison
- Predictive modeling for weather forecast
- Seamless integration with Flask for web deployment
- Easy-to-understand visualization of model performance
